# Admin Dashboard

#16th of Februray 2025

Completed the Admin Dashboard project, it was fun I have changed the layout and the style quite a lot from what I wanted to make. I went to coolors.co and picked a random color palette that inspired me and I don't think it turned out to be bad at all honestly.

Overall the project was a really good experience, I've managed to refine and understand things a bit better especially when it comes to making things a bit more responsive than my past projects.
